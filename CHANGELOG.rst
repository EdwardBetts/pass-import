`3.0`_ - 2020-04-26
-------------------

It is the second major rewrite of pass-import. pass import was originally
written as a wrapper for a few scripts to import passwords to password-store.
Then, in version ``2.0``, a first full rewrite has been done. pass-import was
a small python script that can natively import password to pass.

From ``v3.0``, pass-import became a real python program that can be used as it
or as a library to import passwords. It also supports more than pass as a
targeted password manager.


Added
~~~~~
- pass-import is now password manager agnostic, meaning it is not linked to
  password-store anymore. More destination password manager support will be
  added in future releases. In this release, it supports the following
  destination password manager:

  * ``keepass``
  * ``csv``
  * and also to ``pass``.

- For a given manager name, pass-import automatically detects the format of the
  file to import and uses the importer accordingly.
- pass-import can file encrypted by one of the supported algo before to import it.
- pass import is now available in three way:

  * As a ``pass`` extension ``pass import``
  * As an independant command line program: ``pimport``
  * As a python library ``pass_import``

- Added support for the following password managers:

  * Bitwarden (json)
  * Clipperz (html)
  * Dashlane (json)
  * Freeotp+ (json)
  * Padlock (csv)
  * Passman (csv and json)
  * Passpack (csv)
  * Saferpass (csv)
  * Zoho (csv)

- Added Debian packaging.
- Added pip packaging.
